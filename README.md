This is an supervied Machine Learning Technique project .
The main objective was to predict whether the customer will purchase food online or not.
Learnings:
-Before the data was handled i.e biaseness was removed the accuracy was quite high after handling the data .
-But the Prediction was biased so the imbalanced Data was handled by Using Smote .
-Random Forest is the most accurate model as compared to Decision Tree,SVM,XGBOOST.
-The data is not linearly seperable thats the reason we used radial basis function (RBF) which was circularly scattered.
